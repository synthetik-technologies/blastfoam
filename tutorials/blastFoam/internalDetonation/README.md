# Internal detonation tutorial

## Notes

This is a simple case to show an example case in a confined domain using an explosive material that has additional reactions occur after the initial detonation. The Miller afterburn model is used to additional energy (from heat of formation) in to the system. A small outlet is placed on the far side of the domain from the initial charge location.

The case uses adaptive mesh refinement, and took approximately 20 min to complete on a four core desktop.

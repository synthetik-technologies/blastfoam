## Notes

This cases uses the Doan-Nickel equation of state with a simple tabulated thermodynamic model (const Cv) to simulate a 1 kilo-ton TNT equivalent energy pill. The U.S. standard atmosphere model with gravitation acceleration is used. The energy pill is initialized using a 1.5 m uniform sphere. The case also showcases the axisymmetic automatic mesh refinement and load balancing.

The case takes approximately 6 hours to run on a four core desktop.

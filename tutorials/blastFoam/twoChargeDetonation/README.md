# Two charge detonation tutorial

## Notes

This is a simple case to show how to setup a case using multiple charges. A RDX charge is placed on top of a TNT charge. The top charge is activated when the simulation starts, and the TNT uses a pressure based activation model to simulate how the material activates as the pressure wave passes through the material. The activation coefficients are not specific to TNT and should not be used for actually calculations.

This case takes approximately 2 min to run on a single core desktop.

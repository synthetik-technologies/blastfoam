Description
    Solver for highly compressible premixed/partially-premixed
    combustion with turbulence modeling.

    Combusting RANS code using the b-Xi two-equation model.
    Xi may be obtained by either the solution of the Xi transport
    equation or from an algebraic expression.  Both approaches are
    based on Gulder's flame speed correlation which has been shown
    to be appropriate by comparison with the results from the
    spectral model.

    Strain effects are encorporated directly into the Xi equation
    but not in the algebraic approximation.  Further work need to be
    done on this issue, particularly regarding the enhanced removal rate
    caused by flame compression.  Analysis using results of the spectral
    model will be required.

    For cases involving very lean Propane flames or other flames which are
    very strain-sensitive, a transport equation for the laminar flame
    speed is present.  This equation is derived using heuristic arguments
    involving the strain time scale and the strain-rate at extinction.
    the transport velocity is the same as that for the Xi equation.

# movingCone tutorial

## Notes

This case is a modified version of the OpenFOAM movingCone tutorial. The main modification is the use of the movingAdaptiveFvMesh dynamic mesh class. This allows for automatic mesh refinement in addition to the mesh movement.

The case takes approximately 1 hour to run on a single core desktop.

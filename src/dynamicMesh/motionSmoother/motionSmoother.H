Class
    Foam::motionSmoother

Description
    Given a displacement moves the mesh by scaling the displacement back
    until there are no more mesh errors.

    Holds displacement field (read upon construction since need boundary
    conditions) and scaling factor and optional patch number on which to
    scale back displacement.

    E.g.
    \verbatim
        // Construct iterative mesh mover.
        motionSmoother meshMover(mesh, labelList(1, patchi));

        // Set desired displacement:
        meshMover.displacement() = ..

        for (label iter = 0; iter < maxIter; iter++)
        {
            if (meshMover.scaleMesh(true))
            {
                Info<< "Successfully moved mesh" << endl;
                return true;
            }
        }
    \endverbatim

Note
    - Shared points (parallel): a processor can have points which are part of
    pp on another processor but have no pp itself (i.e. it has points
    and/or edges but no faces of pp). Hence we have to be careful when e.g.
    synchronising displacements that the value from the processor which has
    faces of pp get priority. This is currently handled in setDisplacement
    by resetting the internal displacement to zero before doing anything
    else. The combine operator used will give preference to non-zero
    values.

    - Various routines take baffles. These are sets of boundary faces that
    are treated as a single internal face. This is a hack used to apply
    movement to internal faces.

    - Mesh constraints are looked up from the supplied dictionary. (uses
    recursive lookup)
